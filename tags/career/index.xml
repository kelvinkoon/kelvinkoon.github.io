As such, the info presented may be outdated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The guide you are reading assumes you have taken CPSC259 if you are in ELEC or CPSC221 if you are in CPEN / CPSC, which are the introductory Data Structures and Algorithms (DS/A) courses offered at UBC. Though CPSC259 is less in-depth compared to CPSC221, additional reading will remedy the differences. Even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken either course, I hope the article can still provide insight to the current state of tech interviews.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
