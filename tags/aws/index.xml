Thus, this post discusses design considerations for the aforementioned &lt;code>PsTeamsService&lt;/code>. You can try out the API &lt;a href="https://api.statsugiri.gg/teams/gen9vgc2023regulationc/today">here&lt;/a>, complete with &lt;a href="https://github.com/StatsugiriLabs/Statsugiri/wiki/PS-Teams-API-Usage">usage documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After some discussion, I opted for AWS Lambda and API Gateway to handle requests to the DynamoDB storage. Consideration was made for hosting the service on ECS Fargate, but the incurred additional cost and maintenance for compute didn&amp;rsquo;t feel justified. Fewer resources also means fewer points of failure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>State Machines, Pipelines, and Pokémon</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/state-machines-pipelines-pokemon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/state-machines-pipelines-pokemon/</guid><description>&lt;p>A year ago, I launched babiri&amp;rsquo;s open-source API. The project&amp;rsquo;s development halted shortly after as I acclimated to full-time work. The service proceeded to implode a few months after, left in radio silence until recently. Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on developing a new suite of robust data tools. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from industry to productionalize projects intersecting with my interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post primarily covers the architecture for the new pipeline for daily data ingest pertaining to &lt;a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokémon Showdown&lt;/a> high-ranked teams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building Babiri.net</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/building-babiri-net/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/building-babiri-net/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>As of 2023, babiri.net has been rebranded to &lt;a href="https://github.com/StatsugiriLabs/Statsugiri">Statsugiri&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>After 2 months and 132 commits, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kelvinkoon/babiri_v2">babiri V2&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s API has been launched! babiri is comprised of an API for aggregated usage stats gathered from Pokémon Showdown replays. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share how babiri came to be and the technology powering the project. This post is inspired by Kevin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2020/03/architecting-zeal-gg/">zeal.gg&lt;/a> write-up, which is a fantastic read on another competitive gaming tool.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
