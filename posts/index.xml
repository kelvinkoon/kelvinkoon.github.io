Thus, this post discusses design considerations for the aforementioned &lt;code&gt;PsTeamsService&lt;/code&gt;. You can try out the API &lt;a href="https://api.statsugiri.gg/teams/gen9vgc2023regulationc/today"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, complete with &lt;a href="https://github.com/StatsugiriLabs/Statsugiri/wiki/PS-Teams-API-Usage"&gt;usage documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussion, I opted for AWS Lambda and API Gateway to handle requests to the DynamoDB storage. Consideration was made for hosting the service on ECS Fargate, but the incurred additional cost and maintenance for compute didn&amp;rsquo;t feel justified. Fewer resources also means fewer points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>State Machines, Pipelines, and Pokémon</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/state-machines-pipelines-pokemon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/state-machines-pipelines-pokemon/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="prologue"&gt;Prologue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I launched babiri&amp;rsquo;s open-source API. The project&amp;rsquo;s development halted shortly after as I acclimated to full-time work. The service proceeded to implode a few months after, left in radio silence until recently. With the advent of 2023, I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired the bandwidth to focus on developing a new suite of robust data tools. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from industry to productionalize projects intersecting with my interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Babiri.net</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/building-babiri-net/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/building-babiri-net/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="editors-note"&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, babiri.net has been rebranded to &lt;a href="https://github.com/StatsugiriLabs/Statsugiri"&gt;Statsugiri&lt;/a&gt;. To find out more, read &lt;a href="https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/state-machines-pipelines-pokemon/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 months and 132 commits, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kelvinkoon/babiri_v2"&gt;babiri V2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s API has been launched! babiri is comprised of an API for aggregated usage stats gathered from Pokémon Showdown replays. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited to share how babiri came to be, why it exists, and the technology powering the project. This post is also inspired by Kevin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2020/03/architecting-zeal-gg/"&gt;zeal.gg&lt;/a&gt; write-up, which is a fantastic read on another competitive gaming tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>UBC ECE Electives Review</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/ubc-ece-electives/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/ubc-ece-electives/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="prologue"&gt;Prologue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBC&amp;rsquo;s Electrical and Computer Engineering department offers no shortage of advanced electives for upper year students. As someone who has a tendency to like too many things, I&amp;rsquo;ve worried about fitting all my interests into 12 credits. Though I ended up taking more credits than needed, the opportunity to dive into new fields was invaluable to my learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over the advanced electives I took to hopefully help you decide which electives may (or may not) be suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>LeetCode Intro Guide</title><link>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/leetcode-intro-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kelvinkoon.github.io/posts/leetcode-intro-guide/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="prologue"&gt;Prologue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide you are reading assumes you have taken &lt;a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&amp;amp;tname=subj-course&amp;amp;dept=CPSC&amp;amp;course=259"&gt;CPSC259&lt;/a&gt; if you are in ELEC or &lt;a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&amp;amp;tname=subj-course&amp;amp;dept=CPSC&amp;amp;course=221"&gt;CPSC221&lt;/a&gt; if you are in CPEN / CPSC, which are the introductory Data Structures and Algorithms (DS/A) courses offered at UBC. Although CPSC259 is less in-depth compared to CPSC221, the deficiencies can be remedied through practice. Even if you have not taken either course, the article can still provide take-aways to the current state of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
